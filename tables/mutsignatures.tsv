SBS1	spontaneous 5-methylcytosine deamination	An endogenous mutational process initiated by spontaneous or enzymatic deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine which generates G:T mismatches in double stranded DNA. Failure to detect and remove these mismatches prior to DNA replication results in fixation of the T substitution for C.	Signature SBS1 is clock-like in that the number of mutations in most cancers and normal cells correlates with the age of the individual. Rates of acquisition of Signature SBS1 mutations over time differ markedly between different cancer types and different normal cell types. These differences correlate with estimated rates of stem cell division in different tissues and Signature SBS1 may therefore be a cell division/mitotic clock.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs1
SBS2	APOBEC activity	Attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases on the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems. APOBEC3A is probably responsible for most mutations in human cancer, although APOBEC3B may also contribute (these differ in the sequence context two bases 5’ to the mutated cytosine, see 1,536 mutation classification signature extraction). SBS2 mutations may be generated directly by DNA replication across uracil or by error prone polymerases replicating across abasic sites generated by base excision repair removal of uracil.	SBS2 is usually found in the same samples as SBS13. It has been proposed that activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases in cancer may be due to previous viral infection, retrotransposon jumping, or tissue inflammation. Currently, there is limited evidence to support these hypotheses. Germline polymorphisms involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B are associated with predisposition to breast and bladder cancer as well as with mutation burdens of SBS2 and SBS13. Mutations of similar patterns to SBS2 and SBS13 are commonly found in the phenomenon of local hypermutation present in some cancers, known as kataegis, implicating AID/APOBEC enzymes in this process as well.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs2
SBS3	defective homologous recombination	Defective homologous recombination-based DNA damage repair which manifests predominantly as small indels and genome rearrangements due to abnormal double strand break repair but also in the form of this base substitution signature.	SBS3 is strongly associated with germline and somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and BRCA1 promoter methylation in breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. In pancreatic cancer, responders to platinum therapy usually exhibit SBS3 mutations. Together with associated indel and rearrangement signatures, SBS3 has been proposed as a predictor of defective homologous recombination-based repair and thus of response to therapies exploiting this repair defect.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs3
SBS4	Tobacco-related (smoking)	Associated with tobacco smoking. Its profile is similar to the mutational spectrum observed in experimental systems exposed to tobacco carcinogens such as benzo[a]pyrene. SBS4 is, therefore, likely due to direct DNA damage by tobacco smoke mutagens.	Although tobacco smoking causes multiple cancer types in addition to lung and head and neck, SBS4 has not been detected in many of these. SBS29 is found in cancers associated with tobacco chewing and appears different from SBS4.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs4
SBS5	unknown, clock-like	Unknown. SBS5 mutational burden is increased in bladder cancer samples with ERCC2 mutations and in many cancer types due to tobacco smoking.	SBS5 is clock-like in that the number of mutations in most cancers and normal cells correlates with the age of the individual. Rates of acquisition of SBS5 mutations over time differ between different cancer types and different normal cell types. These differences do not clearly correlate with estimated rates of stem cell division in different tissues nor with differences in SBS1 mutation rates. SBS5 may be contaminated by SBS16.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs5
SBS6	mismatch repair defects	SBS6 is associated with defective DNA mismatch repair and is found in microsatellite unstable tumours.	SBS6 is one of seven mutational signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair and microsatellite instability (MSI), and is often found in the same samples as other MSI associated signatures: SBS14, SBS15, SBS20, SBS21, SBS26, and SBS44.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs6
SBS7a	UV light	SBS7a/SBS7b/SBS7c/SBS7d are found in cancers of the skin from sun exposed areas and are thus likely to be due to exposure to ultraviolet light. SBS7a may possibly be the consequence of just one of the two major known UV photoproducts, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6-4 photoproducts. However, there is currently no evidence for this hypothesis and it is unclear which of these photoproducts may be responsible for SBS7a.	No comments.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs7a
SBS7b	UV light	SBS7a/SBS7b/SBS7c/SBS7d are found in cancers of the skin from sun exposed areas and are likely to be due to exposure to ultraviolet light. SBS7b may possibly be the consequence of just one of the two major known UV photoproducts, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6-4 photoproducts. However, there is no evidence for this hypothesis and it is unclear which of these photoproducts may be responsible for SBS7b	No comments.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs7b
SBS7c	UV light	SBS7a/SBS7b/SBS7c/SBS7d are found in cancers of the skin from sun exposed areas and are likely to be due to exposure to ultraviolet light. SBS7c is possibly the consequence of translesion DNA synthesis by enzymes with propensity to insert T, rather than A, opposite ultraviolet induced thymidine and cytidine photodimers. The preponderance of T>A rather than T>C mutations may reflect the heavier burden of thymidine compared to cytidine dimers induced by UV light.	No comments.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs7c
SBS7d	UV light	SBS7a/SBS7b/SBS7c/SBS7d are found in cancers of the skin from sun exposed areas and are likely to be due to exposure to ultraviolet light. SBS7d is possibly the consequence of translesion DNA synthesis by error-prone polymerases with greater propensity to insert G, rather than A, opposite UV light induced thymidine and cytidine photodimers.

SBS11	chemotherapeutic agents (temozolomide)	SBS11 exhibits a mutational pattern resembling that of alkylating agents.

SBS13	APOBEC activity	Attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases on the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems. APOBEC3A is probably responsible for most mutations in human cancer, although APOBEC3B may also contribute (these differ in the sequence context two bases 5’ to the mutated cytosine, see 1536 mutation classification signature extraction). SBS13 mutations are likely generated by error prone polymerases (such as REV1) replicating across abasic sites generated by base excision repair removal of uracil.	SBS13 is usually found in the same samples as SBS2. It has been proposed that activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases in cancer may be due to previous viral infection, retrotransposon jumping, or tissue inflammation. Currently, there is limited evidence to support these hypotheses. Germline polymorphisms involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B are associated with predisposition to breast and bladder cancer as well as with mutation burdens of SBS2 and SBS13. Mutations of similar patterns to SBS2 and SBS13 are commonly found in the phenomenon of local hypermutation present in some cancers, known as kataegis, implicating AID/APOBEC enzymes in this process as well.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs13

SBS16	associated with alcohol consumption	Associated with alcohol consumption.	In addition to lower levels of nucleotide excision repair on the untranscribed strands of genes, elevated levels of DNA damage on untranscribed strands (compared to the remainder of the genome) may contribute to SBS16. Contamination by SBS16 may still be present in the current version of SBS5.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs16
SBS17a	unknown etiology	Unknown aetiology.	No comments.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/sbs/sbs17a
SBS17b	unknown etiology	In the vast majority of tumours the aetiology is unknown. However, in some cases, previous studies have associated SBS17b to fluorouracil (5FU) chemotherapy treatment and to damage inflicted by reactive oxygen species.
